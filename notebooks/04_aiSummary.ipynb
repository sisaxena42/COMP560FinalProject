      "The machine learning models used in this project demonstrated promising results in predicting country-level GDP from environmental and clinical risk factors. The linear regression model performed well, with a strong coefficient of determination (R-squared) and relatively low root mean squared error (RMSE), indicating the model can accurately estimate GDP based on the input features. The stochastic gradient descent (SGD) regression model also performed reasonably well, though slightly less than the linear model.\n",
      "\n",
      "The classification model, using logistic regression with gradient descent, achieved high accuracy and F1-score, suggesting it can effectively categorize countries into different GDP levels based on the provided risk factors.\n",
      "\n",
      "The feature importance analysis revealed that two variables, \"Air pollution\" and \"Child wasting,\" were the most predictive of GDP. Interestingly, both features exhibited negative coefficients, indicating that higher levels of air pollution and child wasting are associated with lower GDP.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the results of this project suggest that environmental and clinical risk factors can be valuable predictors of country-level economic performance. The models demonstrate a good balance of predictive power and interpretability, highlighting the potential of using these types of features for GDP forecasting and economic policy planning at the national level.\n"
