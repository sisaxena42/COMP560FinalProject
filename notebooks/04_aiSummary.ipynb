      "In this machine learning project, we aimed to predict country-level GDP and classify countries as having high or low GDP based on environmental and clinical risk-factor features. The regression models, including linear, ridge, and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) methods, achieved moderate performance, with the linear model performing the best in terms of R-squared. The classification models, using logistic regression with both the liblinear and gradient descent solvers, demonstrated strong accuracy and F1-scores, suggesting the models can reliably distinguish between high and low GDP countries.\n",
      "\n",
      "Regarding feature importance, the combined set of environmental and clinical risk factors appears to be the most predictive, outperforming models using either feature set alone. This indicates that both environmental and clinical factors play a significant role in determining GDP at the country level. The specific features driving the models' predictions were not explicitly reported, but the overall pattern suggests that a comprehensive approach considering diverse risk factors is necessary for accurate GDP forecasting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The results highlight the potential of using machine learning techniques to understand the complex relationship between environmental, clinical, and economic factors at a national scale. While the models show promise, further investigation is needed to uncover the nuanced drivers of GDP and explore more advanced modeling approaches for this task.\n"
